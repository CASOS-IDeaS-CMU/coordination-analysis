Input (in CONFIG.json): 
    - Either a single .json or .json.gz file, or a directory containing many of these files
    - The API version used to get the twitter data "V1" or "V2" (all files need to be the same type)
    - Timewindow to consider (in minutes)
    - Filename to write edgelist to (must be .csv)
    - action_types, a list of the action types to consider. The available options are url, hashtag, mention, and combined. Where combined looks at url-hashtag combination

Output: 
    .csv containing a weighted multi-view edgelist where actors are linked based on the number of times they took the same action within the time-window
